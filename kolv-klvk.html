							        <p>This ferry flight marked my first operational ferry mission, and I had the opportunity to share the experience with the aircraft's owner, who was also looking to gain some real-world cross-country experience. After connecting with him through a Facebook group, we planned a date to start the ferry and met at KOLV, ready to begin the adventure.</p>
							
							        <p><strong>Day 1: KOLV (Olive Branch, MS) to KLIT (Little Rock, AR)</strong></p>
							        <p>The weather on Day 1 presented some challenges, with IFR conditions over Tennessee all the way through Texas. We took a VFR-on-top clearance, allowing us to cruise comfortably above the cloud cover. Given that the plane had been sitting idle for some time after a previous ferry attempt by another group, who had to abandon the trip due to icing conditions, we made sure to update the GPS and check our flight plans carefully to ensure everything was set for the journey ahead.</p>
							        <p>As night fell, we landed at KLIT, after a long day battling strong headwinds. The weather hadn’t let up, and the conditions kept us on our toes.</p>
							
							        <p><strong>Day 2: KLIT to KMDD (Midland, TX)</strong></p>
							        <p>On Day 2, we departed KLIT once again under IFR conditions, but with a VFR-on-top clearance, we were able to cruise safely. We made a quick fuel stop at KRPH, where we also grabbed a bite to eat before continuing our journey to KMDD. Finally, as we entered Texas, the weather cleared up, and we were able to enjoy some stunning VFR conditions for the remainder of the leg.</p>

							        <p><strong>Day 3: KMDD to KRYN (Yuma, AZ)</strong></p>
							        <p>Day 3 brought us to KLRU, an airport nestled in mountainous terrain, after crossing the vast expanse of Texas. There, we met some wonderful people and witnessed some impressive fly-bys and landings from military aircraft and rotorcraft. After refueling and enjoying some food, we continued to KRYN, where we parked for the night. We met more great people at the FBO and had the chance to talk about aviation, further enriching the experience.</p>

							        <p><strong>Day 4: KRYN to KLVK (Livermore, CA)</strong></p>
							        <p>On Day 4, we departed KRYN for KMHV, the airplane graveyard located in California. We navigated high terrain and stayed vigilant to avoid Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). The breathtaking views during this leg were incredible, and the opportunity to visit the airplane graveyard was truly one-of-a-kind. After refueling and grabbing a bite, we pressed on towards our final destination, KLVK. Flying over the Sierra Nevadas was a remarkable experience, and due to the high terrain in the area, we circled to our cruise altitude before crossing the mountains and entering the valley. We finally touched down at KLVK, marking the successful completion of the ferry.</p>

							        <p>Through this journey, both the owner and I were welcomed by the warmth and hospitality of the General Aviation (GA) community. We met so many friendly and helpful people along the way, and it was an enriching experience to see the support and camaraderie within this field.</p>
							
							        <p>Along the way, I was able to teach the owner various skills in pilotage, including dead reckoning and flight calculations, as well as help him get up to speed with the avionics installed in the aircraft. It was a pleasure to guide him through these aspects and give him the confidence to better understand his aircraft and navigate the skies safely. This ferry flight was not just about delivering an aircraft—it was a journey that deepened both our knowledge and appreciation for aviation.</p>
